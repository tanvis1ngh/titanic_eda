# 🛳️ Titanic EDA Project

An exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on understanding the survival patterns of Titanic passengers using Python, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This EDA project investigates how different factors like passenger class, age, fare, and survival status are related. The goal is to extract meaningful patterns using data cleaning and visualization techniques.

---

## 📁 Project Files

- `EDA_EX.ipynb`: Analysis using Seaborn & Matplotlib.
- `EDA_Plotly.ipynb`: Interactive visuals using Plotly.

## 🔍 Dataset Description

The dataset comes from [Data Science Dojo's Titanic dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/titanic.csv). It includes data on 891 passengers, with columns such as:

- **Survived** (1 = Yes, 0 = No)  
- **Pclass** (Passenger class)  
- **Age**, **Sex**, **Fare**  
- **SibSp**, **Parch** (Family aboard)  
- **Embarked** (Port of embarkation)

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

- **Python**  
- **Pandas** – for data cleaning and exploration  
- **Seaborn** – for creating statistical plots  
- **Matplotlib** – for additional visualization control  
- **Plotly** – for interactive data visualizations  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – development environment

---

## 📊 Key Visualizations

- 📉 **Bar Chart**: Survival rate by class (Seaborn)
- 📈 **Histogram**: Age distribution with KDE curve
- 🎯 **Scatter Plot**: Age vs Fare (Seaborn)
- 🧊 **Boxplot**: Age distribution grouped by survival status
- 🌈 **Interactive Bar Plot**: Survival rate by class using Plotly
- 🖱️ **Hoverable Scatter Plot**: Age vs Fare with tooltips (Plotly)

---

## 📈 Insights & Takeaways

- **First-class passengers** generally had higher survival rates.  
- **Age distributions** suggest younger passengers had slightly higher survival tendencies.  
- **Boxplots** highlighted how age varied between survivors and non-survivors.  
- **Plotly visuals** helped create interactive and intuitive charts.

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to clean and prepare real-world datasets  
- Creating effective visualizations using Seaborn and Plotly  
- Interpreting survival patterns based on age, class, and fare  
- Building both static and interactive plots in Python  

---

## ✨ Future Work

- Add more Plotly interactive visualizations (already started in a separate notebook)  
- Explore gender-based survival analysis  
- Build a dashboard using Dash or Streamlit  
- Try modeling survival with logistic regression
